## Overview

### The challenge

Count down the days, hours, minutes, and seconds until your website launch with the Launch Countdown Timer! 

This webpage allows users to 

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page and features a live countdown timer that ticks down every second. 
- The countdown starts at 14 days and users can watch as the numbers change, flipping from the middle for added visual appeal.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

You will find all the required assets in the `/design` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

### What I learned

This project really challenges your understanding of fundamental concepts of CSS and JS and through this project I also got to know about a new feature of CSS named keyframe to implement animation in CSS as shown below-

```css
@keyframes flip-top {
    to {
        transform: rotateX(90deg);
    }
}
@keyframes flip-bottom {
    to {
        transform: rotateX(0deg);
    }
}
```

### Continued development

The continuously learning journey of a programmer never ends. This project made me realize that there are many concepts that I need to work upon including fundamentals like flex-box and its properties, to more complex concepts like working with fetch and async await in javascript. These areas are some that I think I need to work more upon in the upcoming future as they highlight some of the most significant regions of web development that are important for every developer to know of. 

These key points mentioned here will help me grow accountable and consistent towards improving at writing good quality code and be a successful full stack developer one day.

### Useful resources
